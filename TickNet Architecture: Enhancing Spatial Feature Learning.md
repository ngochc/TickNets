    - Uses pointwise and depthwise convolutions for streamlined feature extraction.
    - FR mechanism enables skip connections for preserving spatial information.
  - "Tick-shape" Backbone:
    - Characterized by periods of channel expansion and contraction.
    - Optimizes resource usage without sacrificing performance.
  - Outperforms traditional CNNs with fewer parameters and computations.

## Understanding TickNet Architecture
- FR-PDP Block:
  - Combines pointwise (Pw), depthwise (Dw) convolutions, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks.
  - Residual connections for preserving information and stabilizing training.
  - Efficient and robust, enhancing TickNet's performance.
- Backbone:
  - Initial Convolutional Layer: Reduces spatial dimensions and increases depth.
  - Data Batch Normalization: Stabilizes and accelerates training.
  - Stages: Progressively extract complex features through multiple FR-PDP blocks.
  - Final Convolutional Layer: Consolidates features into a compact representation.
