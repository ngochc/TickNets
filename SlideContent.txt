## Slide 2: Introduction and Motivation

*   The Mobile Revolution: The rapid proliferation of mobile and embedded devices is driving the demand for computationally efficient deep learning models.
*   Challenge of Traditional Models: Conventional deep learning models are often too resource-intensive, demanding significant computational power and memory.
*   Lightweight Solutions:  Lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (LWCNNs) offer a solution, balancing performance and efficiency for image-related tasks. 
    *   TickNets are a novel family of LWCNNs, designed for image classification with limited resources.

## Slide 3: Introducing TickNets: Key Features and Advantages

*   TickNets: A Family of Efficient LWCNNs
*   Key Innovations for Efficiency:
    *   Full-Residual Point-Depth-Point (FR-PDP) Perceptron:  Streamlined feature extraction using pointwise and depthwise convolutions.
        *   Preserves crucial spatial information through the Full-Residual (FR) mechanism, enabling skip connections even during downsampling.
    *   "Tick-Shape" Backbone:  Characterized by periods of channel expansion and contraction, inspired by the shape of a checkmark. 
        *   Optimizes resource usage without compromising performance, setting TickNets apart from conventional CNNs with their steady increase in channels.
*   Performance Highlights:  Achieve accuracy comparable to larger models while requiring fewer parameters and computations, ideal for mobile devices and embedded systems.

## Slide 4:  Deep Dive into the FR-PDP Block

*   The Building Block of Efficiency: The FR-PDP block is a fundamental component of TickNets, designed to enhance network efficiency and performance. 
*   Key Components and Their Roles:
    *   Pointwise Convolution (Pw):  Processes each channel independently, reducing parameters and computational cost.
    *   Depthwise Convolution (Dw): Applies a single filter per input channel, emphasizing spatial filtering.
    *   Second Pointwise Convolution (Pw2): Combines output channels from Dw, enriching feature representation.
    *   Pointwise Residual Convolution (PwR): Facilitates residual connections, adjusting dimensions when needed.
    *   Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Block:  Recalibrates feature maps, selectively focusing on the most informative channels, enhancing attention mechanisms. 
*   Residual Connections: Preserving Information and Stability
    *   Allows the input to bypass the convolutional layers and be directly added to the output.
    *   Preserves original information and aids in stabilizing the training process.
*   Visualizing the FR-PDP Block Flow: [Include Figure 2 from the source to showcase the step-by-step processing within the block.]

## Slide 5: Exploring the TickNet Backbone Architecture

*   Backbone: The Core Structure for Feature Extraction
*   Components and Their Functions:
    *   Initial Convolutional Layer:  Processes input image, reducing spatial dimensions while increasing depth for initial feature capture.
    *   Optional Data Batch Normalization: Normalizes outputs, stabilizing and speeding up training.
    *   FR-PDP Blocks:  Extensively used throughout the network for efficient feature processing. 
    *   Stages:  Multiple FR-PDP blocks arranged in stages, progressively extracting more complex features. 
    *   Final Convolutional Layer:  Consolidates extracted features for a compact representation.
    *   Global Average Pooling:  Reduces spatial dimensions, summarizing feature maps for the classifier.
    *   Classifier:  Fully connected layer that predicts class probabilities.
*   Visualizing the Backbone:  [Include Figure 3 to illustrate the organization of components within the backbone.]

## Slide 6: Comparing TickNet Architectures: Basic, Small, Large

*   A Family of Architectures:  TickNet offers various architectures: Basic, Small, and Large, differing in complexity, depth, and capacity to capture features.
*   Basic Architecture: Simplest design, efficient for less complex tasks.
    *   [Include Figure 5 for a visual representation of the Basic architecture.]
*   Small Architecture:  Increased complexity and depth, suitable for moderately complex tasks.
    *   [Include Figure 6 to showcase the Small architecture.] 
*   Large Architecture:  Most complex and deepest, ideal for handling intricate patterns in highly complex tasks.
    *   [Include Figure 7 to display the Large architecture.] 

## Slide 7: The "Tick-Shape" Design Philosophy: Channel Elasticity

*   "Plumb" Backbone in Conventional LWCNNs:  Characterized by a consistent increase in output channels after each block, like in MobileNets.
*   TickNets' "Tick-Shape" Backbone:  Introduces channel elasticity, with a fluctuating number of channels resembling a checkmark.
*   Visualizing the Difference: [Include a simplified diagram comparing the "plumb" and "tick-shape" backbone designs.] 
*   Advantages of Channel Elasticity:
    *   More Efficient Parameter Usage:  Avoids the rapid parameter growth seen in traditional "plumb" backbones, especially in final layers.
    *   Strategic Placement of FR-PDP Blocks:  FR-PDP blocks with varying strides control the expansion and contraction of channels, leading to a more efficient use of resources.

## Slide 8: Enhancing TickNets:  Incorporating Spread-Learned Spatial Features

*   Beyond the Baseline: While TickNet is a powerful architecture, its performance can be further improved.
*   Leveraging Spatial Information:  Spread-learned spatial features aim to enrich feature representation and classification accuracy.
*   Three-Step Approach:
    *   Spatial Feature Learning: Extract and process features to capture complex spatial relationships within images using advanced convolutional and pooling operations.
    *   Feature Spreading: Distribute learned spatial features across different layers of the network, ensuring each layer benefits from the spatial information.
    *   TickNet Backbone Modification: Adapt and integrate these spatial features effectively throughout the network architecture.

## Slide 9: Proposed Enhancements and Their Impact
